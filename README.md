# AidUp!

##Welcome to a social site for people who are trying to make the world a better place!

AidUp! is a site created with a simple objective: Increasing the amount of charity work in our communities and making it more accessible for volunteers to join!
By emulating other social network models, AidUp! creates a community of users that can post any kind of charity work or events that they will do, as well as join events that other users have created... So think Linkedin for charity purposes, where instead of creating connections and networks of professionals, we can create a network of people who just want to make the world a better place!

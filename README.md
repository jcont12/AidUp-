# AidUp!

## Welcome to a social site for people who are trying to make the world a better place!

-AidUp!- is a site created with a simple objective:
Increasing the amount of volunteer work in our communities and making it more accessible for volunteers to join!

Emulating other social network models, -AidUp!- creates a community of users that can post any volunteer initiatives for other users to join...
So think Linkedin for volunteering purposes: Instead of creating a dynamic Network for professionals, -AidUp!- creates a network of people who just want to make the world a better place!
